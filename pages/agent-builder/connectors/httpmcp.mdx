<ConnectorTitle name="HTTP MCP Server" />


Connect Cardinal Agent Builder to a custom HTTP MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for extended functionality.

## Overview

HTTP MCP Server allows you to connect to custom Model Context Protocol servers over HTTP. With the HTTP MCP Server connector, your AI agents can:

- **Access custom tools and resources** from your MCP server
- **Extend agent capabilities** with domain-specific functionality
- **Integrate external services** through MCP protocol
- **Query custom data sources** via HTTP endpoints
- **Leverage custom workflows** defined in your MCP server

## Connection Details

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | A unique identifier for this MCP server (e.g., `my-mcp-server`) |
| **Display Name** | A friendly name to display in the UI (e.g., `MCP Server`) |
| **MCP Server URL** | The HTTP URL of your MCP server endpoint |
| **Authentication Type** | Authentication method for the MCP server connection |
| **Share credentials** | (Optional) Share credentials with organization |

## Prerequisites

- HTTP MCP server deployed and accessible
- MCP server URL (e.g., `https://your-mcp-server.com/mcp`)
- Network access to the MCP server
- Appropriate authentication credentials if required

## Setup Wizard

### Step 1: Server Identification

1. In Cardinal Agent Builder, go to **Connectors** and click **Browse Connectors**
2. Select **HTTP MCP Server**
3. Enter a **Name** for this MCP server
   - Example: `my-mcp-server`, `custom-tools`, `external-api`
   - This is a unique identifier used internally
4. Enter a **Display Name** for this connection
   - Example: `MCP Server`, `Custom Tools`, `External API`
   - This is displayed in the Cardinal Agent Builder UI

### Step 2: Server Configuration

1. Enter your **MCP Server URL**
   - Example: `https://your-mcp-server.com/mcp`
   - The HTTP URL of your MCP server endpoint
   - Include the protocol (http or https)

2. Select your **Authentication Type** from the dropdown
   - **No Authentication** - For public or locally accessible servers
   - Additional authentication methods available based on your MCP server requirements

### Step 3: Credentials Storage (Optional)

1. Check **Share credentials with organization** to securely share with your organization
   - When disabled: credentials are stored locally on this device
   - When enabled: credentials are securely shared with your organization members

### Step 4: Save

1. Click **Save** to complete the configuration
2. Cardinal Agent Builder will verify connectivity to your HTTP MCP server

Your AI agent can now access tools and resources from your custom MCP server.
