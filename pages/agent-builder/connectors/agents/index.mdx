## Assets Deep Dive

Cardinal Agent Builder provides a comprehensive platform with multiple interconnected features that work together to help you monitor, analyze, and automate your infrastructure:

### 1. Agents

**What it is:** The core of Cardinal - AI-powered agents are autonomous assistants that can monitor your infrastructure, answer questions about your systems, and execute actions based on events and triggers.

#### Getting Started with Agents:

There are three ways to work with agents in Cardinal:

##### 1. Import an Agent

Import pre-built agents from the Agent Templates. These are fully configured and ready to use out of the box, requiring minimal setup to get started.

##### 2. Create Your Custom Agent

Build a custom agent from scratch tailored to your specific needs. Define the agent's capabilities and connectors to match your exact use case.

##### 3. Clone Existing Agent

Start with an existing agent and clone it as a template. Customize the cloned agent to fit your requirements while keeping the original structure and configuration as a foundation.

### 2. Connectors

![Connectors](/Connectors.png)

**What it is:** Connectors enable Cardinal to integrate with various data sources and platforms including cloud providers, monitoring tools, incident management systems, and communication platforms.

**Sharing & Organization:**

Connectors you add are configured globally and shared within your organization. When configuring connectors, you have the flexibility to control credential sharing:

- **Global Configuration** - Connectors are set up once and available to all team members in your organization
- **Credential Sharing** - During connector setup, you can enable "Share with Org" for credentials, allowing other team members to use the same connector without needing separate authentication
- **Credential Security** - Choose which credentials to share organizationally while keeping sensitive information restricted if needed

---

### 3. Knowledge

![Knowledge](/Knowledgebase.png)

**What it is:** A knowledge base system that allows you to add custom context, documentation, and runbooks that agents can reference when answering questions or making decisions.

**How it's useful:**

- Provide agents with company-specific information and context
- Create runbooks and standard operating procedures
- Improve accuracy of agent responses with domain knowledge
- Enable agents to provide more personalized and contextual answers
- Keep information centralized and easy to update

**Knowledge Scope:**

You can add knowledge at different levels to match your needs:

- **Global Knowledge** - Organization-wide knowledge accessible to all agents across your instance
- **Connector-Specific Knowledge** - Knowledge tied to specific connectors, providing contextual information about particular data sources that agents can reference
- **Agent-Specific Knowledge** - Knowledge tailored to individual agents, allowing you to customize what information each agent has access to based on its role and responsibilities

---

### 4. Reports

![Reports](/Reports.png)

**What it is:** Reports are collections of queries that you can execute together and run on a schedule. A report bundles multiple queries and automated execution to deliver insights to your team.

**Report Features:**

- **Query Collections** - Combine multiple queries into a single report that runs together
- **Multi-Agent Queries** - Add queries from different agents in the same report to get comprehensive insights across your infrastructure
- **Scheduled Execution** - Set up reports to run on a schedule (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
- **Slack Integration** - Automatically send reports to Slack channels or direct messages, keeping your team informed without manual effort
- **Centralized Insights** - Bundle related queries and deliver results to the right team members at the right time

---

### 5. Queries

![Queries](/Queries.png)

**What it is:** A powerful query interface that allows you to ask natural language questions and execute structured queries against your connected data sources.

**How it's useful:**

- Ask questions like "What was deployed last week?" or "Show me error rates by service"
- Get instant answers from all your connected data sources
- Explore historical data and trends
- Build custom views of your infrastructure
- Reduce time spent hunting through logs and dashboards

**Query Workflow:**

- **Auto-Generated** - Queries are automatically generated when you build your agent, capturing the information sources and logic needed
- **Iterate & Test** - Refine queries by executing them to see visualizations and outputs, ensuring they return the right data
- **Publish to Organization** - Once you're satisfied with a query, publish it to make it available to the entire organization for use in reports, dashboards, and other agents

---

### 6. Workflows

![Workflows](/Workflows.png)

**What it is:** Workflow automation engine that allows you to define automated actions and decision logic based on events, metrics, and conditions.

**How it's useful:**

- Automate routine operational tasks
- Create conditional logic for incident response
- Trigger actions across multiple systems automatically
- Reduce manual intervention and human error
- Chain together multiple actions into complex sequences

**Workflow Creation:**

- **Extract from Chat** - Once you've finished building and testing your agent in the chat interface, you can extract workflows directly from the conversation
- **Automated Workflow Generation** - Based on the actions and logic your agent executed, workflows are generated that can be reused and scheduled
- **Reusable Automation** - Convert ad-hoc agent interactions into repeatable, scheduled workflows that run without manual intervention

---

### 7. Scripts

![Scripts](/Scripts.png)

**What it is:** Custom scripting capability that allows you to write and execute automation scripts for specialized tasks and integrations.

**How it's useful:**

- Extend Cardinal's capabilities with custom logic
- Automate complex multi-step operations
- Integrate with custom systems and tools
- Create reusable automation templates
- Handle edge cases and specialized scenarios

---

### 8. Chat Modes

#### Single Agent Chat Mode

![Single Agent Chat Mode](/SingleAgentChatMode.png)

**What it is:** Interactive chat interface where you can have a conversation with a single focused agent about your infrastructure and systems.

**How it's useful:**

- Ask follow-up questions naturally
- Get contextual responses based on conversation history
- Explore your systems interactively
- Get explanations and recommendations
- Ideal for investigating specific issues or learning about your infrastructure

#### Multi-Agent Chat Mode

![Multi-Agent Chat Mode](/MultiAgentChatMode.png)

**What it is:** Advanced chat interface that coordinates multiple specialized agents to work together on complex problems.

**How it's useful:**

- Leverage different agents' expertise simultaneously
- Get more comprehensive answers to complex questions
- Enable agents to collaborate and build on each other's insights
- Handle scenarios that require multiple perspectives
- Solve complex multi-domain problems more effectively
