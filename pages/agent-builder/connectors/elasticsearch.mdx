Connect Cardinal Agent Builder to Elasticsearch for querying and analyzing logs, metrics, and search data.

## Overview

Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine. With the Elasticsearch connector, your AI agents can:

- **Query logs and events** from Elasticsearch
- **Search across large datasets** efficiently
- **Analyze time-series data** and metrics
- **Extract insights** from your Elasticsearch clusters
- **Access distributed data** across multiple indices

## Connection Details

| Field                 | Description                                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Display Name**      | Custom name for this Elasticsearch connection               |
| **URL**               | Base URL of your Elasticsearch cluster endpoint             |
| **Authentication**    | Authentication method (None, API Key, or Username/Password) |
| **Share credentials** | (Optional) Share credentials with organization              |

## Prerequisites

- Elasticsearch cluster deployed and running
- Network access to your Elasticsearch server
- Elasticsearch URL (e.g., `https://my-cluster.es.io:9243`)
- Authentication credentials if required (API Key or Username/Password)

## Setup Wizard

### Step 1: Connection Configuration

1. In Cardinal Agent Builder, go to **Connectors** and click **Browse Connectors**
2. Select **Elasticsearch**
3. Enter a **Display Name** for this Elasticsearch connection
   - Example: `Elasticsearch`, `Prod Logs`, `Analytics Cluster`
   - A friendly name to identify this connection

### Step 2: Elasticsearch Configuration

1. Enter your **URL**

   - Example: `https://my-cluster.es.io:9243`
   - The base URL of your Elasticsearch cluster endpoint
   - Include the protocol (http or https) and port

2. Select your **Authentication** method from the options:

   - **None** - For publicly accessible clusters or local development
   - **API Key** - For API key authentication (recommended for security)
   - **Username/Password** - For basic authentication with username and password

3. If you selected **API Key**:

   - Enter your Elasticsearch API Key
   - Generate at Elasticsearch management UI or Cloud console

4. If you selected **Username/Password**:
   - Enter your username (typically `elastic`)
   - Enter your password for authentication

### Step 3: Credentials Storage (Optional)

1. Check **Share credentials with organization** to securely share with your organization
   - When disabled: credentials are stored locally on this device
   - When enabled: credentials are securely shared with your organization members

### Step 4: Save

1. Click **Next** to verify and continue
2. Click **Save** to complete the configuration
3. Cardinal Agent Builder will verify connectivity to your Elasticsearch cluster

Your AI agent can now query and analyze data from Elasticsearch.
