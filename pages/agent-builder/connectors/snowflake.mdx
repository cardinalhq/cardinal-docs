Connect Cardinal Agent Builder to Snowflake for querying and analyzing data in your Snowflake warehouse.

## Overview

Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehouse platform. With the Snowflake connector, your AI agents can:

- **Query Snowflake databases** and retrieve data
- **Access tables** across your Snowflake warehouse
- **Analyze large datasets** with high performance
- **Execute SQL queries** at scale
- **Integrate data** from your Snowflake instance

## Connection Details

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Account Identifier** | Your Snowflake account identifier |
| **Programmatic Access Token (PAT)** | PAT token for Snowflake authentication |
| **Share credentials** | (Optional) Share credentials with organization |

## Prerequisites

- Snowflake account with warehouse access
- Account identifier (e.g., `abc12345.us-east-1`)
