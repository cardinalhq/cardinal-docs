Connect Cardinal Agent Builder to GitHub for accessing repositories, issues, and pull requests.

## Overview

GitHub is a platform for version control and collaborative development. With the GitHub connector, your AI agents can:

- **Access GitHub repositories** and browse code
- **Query issues and pull requests** for project tracking
- **Analyze repository metadata** and structure
- **Monitor project activity** and contributions
- **Retrieve code insights** from your repositories

## Connection Details

| Field                            | Description                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Display Name**                 | Custom name for this GitHub connection         |
| **GitHub MCP Server URL**        | URL of your GitHub MCP server endpoint         |
| **GitHub Personal Access Token** | PAT for GitHub authentication                  |
| **Share credentials**            | (Optional) Share credentials with organization |

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account with repository access
- GitHub MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configured
- GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with appropriate scopes
- Network access to your GitHub MCP server

## Getting Your GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give your token a descriptive name
4. Select the required scopes based on your MCP server requirements:
   - **repo** - Full control of private repositories
   - **read:org** - Read organization data
   - **read:user** - Read user profile data
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token and paste it into Cardinal Agent Builder (tokens start with `ghp_`)

## Setup Wizard

### Step 1: Connection Configuration

1. In Cardinal Agent Builder, go to **Connectors** and click **Browse Connectors**
2. Select **GitHub**
3. Enter a **Display Name** for this connection
   - Example: "GitHub Prod", "GitHub Dev", "My GitHub"

### Step 2: GitHub MCP Configuration

1. Enter your **GitHub MCP Server URL**

   - Example: `https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp`
   - The HTTP URL of your GitHub MCP server
   - Include the protocol (http or https)

2. Enter your **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**
   - Must start with `ghp_`
   - Found at [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Ensure token has required scopes: `repo`, `read:org`, `read:user`

### Step 3: Credentials Storage (Optional)

1. Check **Share credentials with organization** to securely share with your organization
   - When disabled: credentials are stored locally on this device
   - When enabled: credentials are securely shared with your organization members

### Step 4: Save

1. Click **Save** to complete the configuration
2. Cardinal Agent Builder will verify connectivity to your GitHub MCP server

Your AI agent can now access GitHub repositories, issues, and pull requests.
