## What are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous assistants that can:

- Monitor your cloud infrastructure and deployments
- Query logs, metrics, and traces across multiple platforms
- Correlate deployment events with application behavior
- Provide insights and answer questions about your systems
- Execute workflows based on triggers and conditions

Cardinal Agent Builder includes several pre-built agents for common use cases that can be imported and customized to fit your needs.
