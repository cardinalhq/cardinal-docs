# Agents

Agent is where you build specific queries, workflows, and scripts in one place. Each agent is purpose-built with a distinct role and set of capabilities

## Getting Started with Agents

There are three ways to work with agents in Cardinal:

### 1. Import an Agent

Import pre-built agents from the Agent Templates. These are fully configured and ready to use out of the box, requiring minimal setup to get started.

### 2. Create Your Custom Agent

Build a custom agent from scratch tailored to your specific needs. Define the agent's capabilities and connectors to match your exact use case.

### 3. Clone Existing Agent

Start with an existing agent and clone it as a template. Customize the cloned agent to fit your requirements while keeping the original structure and configuration as a foundation.
