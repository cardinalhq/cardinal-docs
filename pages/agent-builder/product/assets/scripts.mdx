# Scripts

![Scripts](/Scripts.png)

Scripts give you deterministic control over an agent’s behavior so critical actions run every time, predictably, instead of being left to the LLM’s discretion.

Generate scripts as you build agents, turning your workflow into repeatable, reliable actions.

## How it's useful

- Extend Cardinal's capabilities with custom logic
- Automate complex multi-step operations
- Integrate with custom systems and tools
- Create reusable automation templates
