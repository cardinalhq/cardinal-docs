# Workflows

![Workflows](/Workflows.png)

Workflows are production-ready, reusable agent playbooks—built as step-by-step automations (trigger → actions → output) that let your agents run investigations, generate results, and deliver outcomes automatically (for example, to Slack).

## How it's useful

- Automate routine operational tasks
- Create conditional logic for incident response
- Trigger actions across multiple systems automatically
- Reduce manual intervention and human error
- Chain together multiple actions into complex sequences

## Workflow Creation

- **Extract from Chat** - Once you've finished building and testing your agent in the chat interface, you can extract workflows directly from the conversation
- **Automated Workflow Generation** - Based on the actions and logic your agent executed, workflows are generated that can be reused and scheduled
- **Reusable Automation** - Convert ad-hoc agent interactions into repeatable, scheduled workflows that run without manual intervention
