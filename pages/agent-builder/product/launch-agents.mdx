# Launch Agents

Launching your Agents into your own cloud environment enables capabilities such as:
- Talking to your Agents in Slack through a [Slack Assistant](/agent-builder/connectors/slack)
- Invoking Agents to perform tasks from external tools using HTTP webhooks
- Executing scheduled [Reports](/agent-builder/product/assets/reports) and [Workflows](/agent-builder/product/assets/workflows)

### 1. Create a Launch Profile

Launch Profiles are used to configure the cloud environment in which your Agents will be launched.

1. In the VibeShield app, click on your name in the bottom-left corner, and select the **Organization Settings** menu item.

2. Select the **Launch Profiles** tab.

3. Click on the **Create Profile** button, and select your cloud provider (GCP, AWS, or Azure).

4. Give the profile a name, select the GCP Project that you would like to deploy into, and enter a Google Group containing members that should have permissions to deploy to this project.

5. Click **Create** to save the profile.

### 3. Configure Slack Event Subscriptions

If a [Slack Connector](/agent-builder/connectors/slack) is configured in your workspace, the Launch Status card will include an Event Subscription URL that must be configured in your Slack bot app in order to talk to your Agents in Slack.

1. Follow the link to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps).

2. Select the Slack bot app that you created when adding the Slack Connector.

3. Select the **Event Subscriptions** tab from the sidebar.

4. Copy the Event Subscription URL from the Launch Status card, and paste it into the **Request URL** field.

### 4. Invoke Agents via HTTP Webhook

Once your Agents are launched, you can invoke them from external tools (e.g. GitHub Actions, etc.) to perform tasks via a `/invoke` HTTP webhook.

The Launch Status card includes your HTTP webhook URL, and an example cURL command to invoke an Agent.

```bash copy
curl -X POST https://{your-agent-url}/invoke \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agentName": "my-agent", "message": "Perform this task"}'
```

The request body must be a JSON object with the following fields:

- `agentName`: (required) The name of the Agent to invoke
- `message`: (required) The message to send to the Agent
- `delayInMinutes`: (optional) The number of minutes to delay the task execution (e.g. `30`)

Requests without a `delayInMinutes` are executed synchronously, and return the results of the task execution. Requests with a `delayInMinutes` are executed asynchronously, and return immediately with the time that the task will be executed.
