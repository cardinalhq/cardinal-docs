# Org Settings

Organization settings are the control center for team access, shared configuration, and launch defaults. Use them to keep agents, workflows, and deployments consistent across the org.

## At a Glance

- **Members**: invite teammates, manage access, and review pending invites.
- **Subscription**: manage plan, seats, and billing.
- **Remote Repository**: connect a GitHub repo used to sync agent configurations.
- **Launch Profiles**: set default cloud deployment profiles per provider.
- **Launch Agents**: deploy and manage cloud agents.
- **LLM Provider**: choose the org-wide model provider and defaults.

## How Org Settings Are Used

- **Chip Studio UI** exposes the settings tabs (Members, Subscription, Remote Repository, Launch Profiles, Launch Agents, LLM Provider).
- **CardinalHQ MCP** stores org-level configuration like the selected LLM provider and workflow defaults.
- **Agent Runner** uses org settings to clone and sync the workspace from the remote repo and to initialize model access.
