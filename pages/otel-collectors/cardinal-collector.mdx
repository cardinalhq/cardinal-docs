# Cardinal OpenTelemetry Collector

Running a Cardinal OpenTelemetry Collector within your VPC/infrastructure enables you to use Chip while only sending **< 0.01%** of your telemetry data to Cardinal.

- Recommended if your telemetry data volume is high
- Runs downstream of your existing OpenTelemetry Collector, within your own VPC/infrastructure
- Sends only minimal exemplars and aggregates to Cardinal, not raw telemetry data

*(If your telemetry data volume is low, or you prefer to not install a new Collector, refer to the [OTLP Export to Cardinal](/otel-collectors/export-to-cardinal) section for an alternative)*

### Install the Cardinal Kubernetes Operator

The Cardinal Kubernetes Operator simplifies the deployment and management of Cardinal OpenTelemetry Collectors on Kubernetes.

**Prerequisites**

- [Helm](https://helm.sh) v3 or later
- Kubernetes cluster with permissions to install `CRDs`, `ClusterRoles`, and `ClusterRoleBindings`

**Install the Operator**

```sh copy
helm install chq-operator oci://public.ecr.aws/cardinalhq.io/cardinalhq-operator \
  --namespace chq-operator \
  --create-namespace
```

This command installs the Operator, its necessary roles, and the CRD for Collector resources in your cluster.

### Deploy a Collector

Next, let's deploy a Cardinal OpenTelemetry Collector.

1. [Sign-in to Cardinal,](https://app.cardinalhq.io) and select the **Pipelines** tab in the left sidebar.
2. Click the **Add a Collector...** button.
3. Follow the steps to create a Kubernetes Secret for your Cardinal API key, and apply the CRD manifest to deploy your new Collector.

### Send Data to the Collector

If you have an existing OpenTelemetry Collector, add an OTLP Exporter to its pipeline to send data to this Cardinal OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP Receiver.

```yaml copy
exporters:
  otlphttp/cardinal-collector:
    endpoint: http://<your-k8s-ingress-or-service-endpoint>

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      exporters: [otlphttp/cardinal-collector]

    logs:
      exporters: [otlphttp/cardinal-collector]

    traces:
      exporters: [otlphttp/cardinal-collector]
```

If you don't have an existing OpenTelemetry Collector, point your application OpenTelemetry SDKs to this Collector's OTLP Receiver using the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable, as outlined in the language-specific SDK documentation.
