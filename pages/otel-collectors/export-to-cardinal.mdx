# OTLP Export to Cardinal

With an existing OpenTelemetry Collector, getting onboarded to Chip is as simple as adding an OTLP Exporter to your Collector pipeline.

- Recommended for fast onboarding, PoCs, or if your telemetry data volume is low
- Sends raw telemetry data to Cardinal

*(If your telemetry data volume is high, and you prefer not to send it all to Cardinal, refer to the [Cardinal OpenTelemetry Collector](/otel-collectors/cardinal-collector) section for an alternative)*

### Add an OTLP Exporter

Update your Collector configuration `yaml` to add a new exporter, and include it in your pipelines for metrics, logs, and traces.

```yaml copy
exporters:
  otlphttp/cardinal:
    endpoint: https://otelhttp.intake.us-east-2.aws.cardinalhq.io
    headers:
      x-cardinalhq-api-key: <your-cardinal-api-key>

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      exporters: [otlphttp/cardinal]

    logs:
      exporters: [otlphttp/cardinal]

    traces:
      exporters: [otlphttp/cardinal]
```
