# CardinalHQ Telemetry Overview

CardinalHQ automatically collects and displays key metrics from **collectors**, **rules**, and **sources/destinations**, giving you a comprehensive view of your entire telemetry pipeline. By understanding these three components, you can proactively monitor resource utilization, data flows, and transformation logic—all from a single, unified interface.

## Managed Collector Telemetry
Monitoring the health of your collectors is critical for ensuring uninterrupted data ingestion and transformation. The **[Managed Collector](./telemetry/managed_collector)** page outlines how we capture resource usage (CPU, memory), uptime, and other operational stats, helping you quickly identify capacity issues and potential bottlenecks.

---

## Rule Telemetry
Rules within CardinalHQ govern data transformations such as filtering, masking, sampling, and more. The **[Rules](./telemetry/rules)** page details how you can track:
- **Conditions Matched vs. Not Matched**
- **Rule Evaluation Time**
- **Rule Evaluation Errors**

This telemetry helps you confirm that your rules are effective, understand performance implications, and troubleshoot any misconfigurations.

## Source and Destination Telemetry
Tracking your data’s journey from sources (receivers) to destinations (exporters) ensures every step in the pipeline is transparent. The **[Sources and Destinations](./telemetry/sources_and_destinations)** page explains how to monitor:
- **Accepted vs. Refused Data** at sources
- **Sent vs. Failed Data** at destinations

By measuring acceptance and delivery rates, you can quickly spot ingestion bottlenecks, troubleshoot downstream failures, and maintain data integrity.

By combining insights from these three telemetry categories, you gain a holistic understanding of your pipelines’ health and performance. This integrated view enables fast troubleshooting, proactive scaling, and confident observability across all of your services.
