# Managed Collector Health Metrics

Our Managed Collectors report their operational health as metrics, making it easy to track metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and uptime directly in the [Cardinal UI](https://app.cardinalhq.io). You can identify these collector-specific metrics by looking for:

- **Metric Names** beginning with `k8s.*` (e.g., `k8s.container.cpu_limit_utilization`, `k8s.container.memory_limit_utilization`) etc.
- **Tags** enable you to filter to your particular collector eg. ``` metric.cardinalhq.stats_collector_name = <collector_name>```
This tag indicates the particular Managed Collector you’re viewing.

## Health Metrics Overview

**Examples of common Managed Collector metrics include:**

- **CPU Usage**
    `k8s.container.cpu_limit_utilization`: The percentage of the container’s CPU limit currently in use.

- **Memory Usage** `k8s.container.memory_limit_utilization`: The percentage of the container’s memory limit currently in use.
`container.memory.usage`: The total memory the container is actively consuming.

- **Uptime**
`k8s.pod.uptime`: How long the pod has been running since it was started or restarted.

These metrics provide crucial insight into how well your collector’s container is performing under its assigned workload.

## Viewing Metrics in the Cardinal UI

1. **Pipeline Overview**
In the **Collector Pipelines** view, you’ll see a snapshot of CPU, Memory, and Uptime for each collector. This high-level overview helps you quickly identify any collectors nearing resource limits or showing signs of instability.

2. **Detailed Metrics Exploration**
By switching to the **Explore** you can:
 - **Filter:** Focus on a specific collector using the tag
```
metric.cardinalhq.stats_collector_name = <collector_name>
   ```
 - **Query & Visualize:** Search for the relevant metric names (e.g., `k8s.container.cpu_limit_utilization`) to graph them over time.
 - **Combine & Compare:** Correlate these container metrics with other system metrics or business KPIs to get a holistic view of collector performance.

## Why Monitor These Health Metrics?

- **Resource Optimization:** Spot high CPU or memory usage and adjust resource allocations or rules before the collector becomes a bottleneck.
- **Stability & Reliability:** Quickly see if collectors have restarted (via uptime) or if memory usage spikes might lead to crashes.
- **Proactive Troubleshooting:** Historical data helps you pinpoint when usage patterns changed, aiding faster root-cause analysis.
- **Capacity Planning:** Identify long-term trends to decide whether to increase resources, deploy additional collectors, or redistribute workloads.

By tracking these container-level metrics, you gain the clarity needed to keep your Managed Collectors running smoothly and efficiently, ensuring reliable observability for your entire system.
