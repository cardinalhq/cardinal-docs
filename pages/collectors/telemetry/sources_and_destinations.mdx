# Source and Destination Telemetry

Within each **Managed Pipeline**, CardinalHQ provides telemetry metrics that show how data flows through **Sources** (receivers) and **Destinations** (exporters). By examining these metrics, you can quickly see how many data points were accepted or refused at a given source, as well as how many were successfully sent or failed at a destination. This ensures transparency into every step of your pipeline, enabling fast troubleshooting and optimization.

---

## Source (Receiver) Metrics

Each source that receives telemetry data—whether logs, metrics, or traces—emits metrics prefixed with `otelcol_receiver_`. The key metrics are:

- **Accepted Count:**
- `otelcol_receiver_accepted_metric_points`
- `otelcol_receiver_accepted_log_records`
- `otelcol_receiver_accepted_spans`

These show how many items (metrics, logs, or spans) the receiver successfully accepted.

- **Refused Count:**
- `otelcol_receiver_refused_metric_points`
- `otelcol_receiver_refused_log_records`
- `otelcol_receiver_refused_spans`

These show how many items were refused. Refusals might indicate malformed data, unsupported formats, or capacity constraints.

### Example

A source named `my-receiver` might display:
- **Accepted logs**: `otelcol_receiver_accepted_log_records` with the tag `metric.receiver=my-receiver`.
- **Refused logs**: `otelcol_receiver_refused_log_records` with the tag `metric.receiver=my-receiver`.

By summing or graphing these metrics, you can track the volume of successfully ingested data and identify potential drops or refusals.

## Destination (Exporter) Metrics

Each destination, such as a third-party monitoring tool or storage backend, is represented by metrics prefixed with `otelcol_exporter_`. These metrics indicate how many data items the exporter processed and whether any failed to send:

- **Sent Count:**
- `otelcol_exporter_sent_metric_points`
- `otelcol_exporter_sent_log_records`
- `otelcol_exporter_sent_spans`

These show how many items were sent to the destination successfully.

- **Send Failed Count:**
- `otelcol_exporter_send_failed_metric_points`
- `otelcol_exporter_send_failed_log_records`
- `otelcol_exporter_send_failed_spans`

These show how many items could not be delivered (e.g., due to network or authentication issues, downstream rate limits, etc.).

### Example

If you have a destination named `datadog-exporter`, you might see:
- **Sent metrics**: `otelcol_exporter_sent_metric_points` with the tag `metric.exporter=datadog-exporter`.
- **Send failed logs**: `otelcol_exporter_send_failed_log_records` with the tag `metric.exporter=datadog-exporter`.

Tracking these metrics helps you validate that data is reaching its destination and identify any failure patterns.

## Viewing Source and Destination Metrics

You can view these metrics in two ways:

1. **Pipeline View**
- Open the **Collector Pipelines** page to see a graphical representation of your sources and destinations.
- **Click** on a **source** node to view its **“Receiver stats”** tab, or click on a **destination** node to view its **“Exporter stats”** tab.
- You’ll see real-time charts showing how many logs, metrics, or spans were accepted, refused, sent, or failed to send, giving you immediate insights without leaving the pipeline diagram.

2. **Explore Section**
- Navigate to the **Explore** interface in CardinalHQ.
- Filter by `_cardinalhq.name` (e.g., `otelcol_receiver_accepted_log_records`) or by the relevant tags (`metric.receiver=<receiver_name>` or `metric.exporter=<exporter_name>`).
- Chart these metrics over time to see acceptance/refusal rates, or sent/failed counts.

This dual approach helps you both drill into details in the Explore interface and quickly assess source/destination performance in context within the pipeline view.

## Integrating These Metrics

All these source and destination metrics appear as **time-series** data in the CardinalHQ platform, labeled with the relevant `metric.receiver` or `metric.exporter` tags. This makes it easy to:

1. **Filter** by source or destination to isolate the metrics you care about.
2. **Chart** how many data items were accepted vs. refused or sent vs. failed, over time.
3. **Investigate** any anomalies or sudden spikes in failures, refusals, or changes in throughput.

## Why Monitor Source and Destination Metrics?

- **Troubleshooting**: Quickly pinpoint if data drops are happening at the source (refused) or if messages fail to transmit at the destination.
- **Performance Tuning**: Watch for throughput bottlenecks—if a destination is seeing high failure rates, investigate network or quota issues.
- **Data Integrity**: Confirm that the volume of data accepted matches the volume leaving your pipeline, ensuring no silent losses.
- **Capacity & Cost Management**: Identify underutilized or overloaded parts of your pipeline to adjust resources or optimize usage of third-party tools.

By leveraging source and destination metrics alongside collector health metrics, you gain end-to-end visibility into how data flows through your Managed Pipeline. This visibility is crucial for maintaining a robust, efficient observability stack—ensuring that you capture all valuable data while identifying and fixing issues at any point in the pipeline.
