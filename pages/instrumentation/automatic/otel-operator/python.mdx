# Adding instrumentation to Services

Generally, the only deployment change that needs to occur is to add an annotation to the pods that a Deployment, DaemonSet, or StatefulSet creates.

# Signals

By default, you will get traces from many Python libraries without
any additional configuration.  Our recommended `Instrumentation` configuration
will also ensure that logs are sent to the collector.  However, you may
need to make some changes to your application to ensure that you continue
to have console logs.  See [Setting Up `stderr` Logging in Python](../../semiautomatic/python#setting-up-stderr-logging-in-python) for more information.

For more information, see the [opentelemetery-java-autoinstrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation) documentation.

# Auto-Instrumentation for Python

A single annotation is used to enable instrumentation of Python.

> Note: It is important that the attribute is applied to the pod template, and not the Deployment, StatefulSet, or DaemonSet.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: your-python-app-name
  labels:
    ...
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      ...
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        ...
      annotations:
        instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-python: opentelemetry-operator/auto-instrumentation
...
```
