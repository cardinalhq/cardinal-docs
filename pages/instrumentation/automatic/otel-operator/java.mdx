# Adding instrumentation to Services

Generally, the only deployment change that needs to occur is to add an annotation to the pods that a Deployment, DaemonSet, or StatefulSet creates.

# Signals

Java auto-instrumentation will typically set up logs, metrics, and traces to be exported from a large set of
Java libraries without any additional effort.

# Auto-Instrumentation for Java

A single annotation is used to enable instrumentation of Java.

> Note: It is important that the attribute is applied to the pod template, and not the Deployment, StatefulSet, or DaemonSet.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: your-java-app-name
  labels:
    ...
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      ...
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        ...
      annotations:
        instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java: opentelemetry-operator/auto-instrumentation
...
```
