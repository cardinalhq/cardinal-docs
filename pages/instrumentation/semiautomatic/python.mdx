# Python Semi-Automatic Instrumentation

The [OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/platforms/kubernetes/operator/automatic/#auto-instrumenting-python-logs) for Python enables traces with minimal effort, but logging and custom metrics require additional configuration.

## Enabling Auto-Instrumentation for Logs

If you are using our [recommended Instrumentaton](../automatic/otel-operator#installing-instrumentation-configuration),
you should not need to do anything to enable auto-instrumentation for logs.
Ironically, once you have enabled the auto-instrumentation, you will need to
explicitly configure logging to write logs to `stderr` to ensure that logs
continue to be displayed on the console.

## Setting Up `stderr` Logging in Python

By default, Python installs a handler that writes logs to `stderr` if
there are no handlers configured.  However, as the OpenTelemetry Operator
will inject a handler to send logs to the collector, you must
explicitly configure a handler to write logs to `stderr`.

```python
import logging
import sys

# By default, Python logs only at WARN level and higher.  If
# you want to capture INFO level logs, you must set the root
# logger's level to INFO.
logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# Create and configure a StreamHandler for stderr.  You can also
# adjust the level and format of the logs if you wish.
console_handler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stderr)
console_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(console_handler)

# Use the logger as usual

```

## Environment Variables

When using auto-instrumentation via the
[OpenTelemetry Operator](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/platforms/kubernetes/operator/),
you should not have to set any environment variables as the operator will
automatically inject the necessary environment variables into your application's
containers.

Setting some of the `OTEL_*` environment variables manually can cause conflicts
with the auto-instrumentation. For example, changing the endpoint or protocol
for the OTLP exporter can cause the auto-instrumentation to fail.
