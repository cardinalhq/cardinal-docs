# Sources

Sources (receivers) define how telemetry data enters your collector pipeline. Configure these to receive data from your applications and infrastructure.

---

## OTLP

Receives telemetry data via gRPC or HTTP in the [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/) format. This is the recommended receiver for OpenTelemetry-instrumented applications.

**Supports:** Metrics, Logs, Traces

---

## Prometheus

Scrapes metrics from [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) endpoints. Use this to collect metrics from applications that expose Prometheus-format metrics.

**Supports:** Metrics

---

## Prometheus Remote Write

Receives metrics from [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) servers using Remote Write forwarding. Configure your Prometheus server to send metrics to the collector.

**Supports:** Metrics

---

## StatsD

Receives metrics in [StatsD](https://github.com/statsd/statsd) format. Compatible with applications using StatsD client libraries.

**Supports:** Metrics

---

## Logstash

Receives logs from [Elastic Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash) pipelines via TCP.

**Supports:** Logs

---

## Filelog

Collects logs from files on the local filesystem. Useful for collecting application logs written to disk, container logs, and system logs.

**Supports:** Logs

---

## AWS Firehose Metrics

Receives metrics from [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/firehose/). Use this to ingest CloudWatch metrics or other AWS telemetry data.

**Supports:** Metrics

---

## Kubernetes Metrics

Collects pod and container-level metrics from Kubernetes. Automatically discovers and scrapes metrics from pods running in the cluster.

**Supports:** Metrics

---

## Kubernetes Cluster Metrics

Collects cluster-level metrics from Kubernetes, including node metrics, resource quotas, and cluster state information.

**Supports:** Metrics

---

## Kubernetes Events

Captures Kubernetes cluster events such as pod scheduling, container starts/stops, and other cluster activities. Useful for correlating infrastructure events with application telemetry.

**Supports:** Logs (Events)

---

## CHQ IPC

Cardinal internal pipeline communication. Used for routing telemetry between pipeline components within the Cardinal infrastructure.

**Supports:** Metrics, Logs, Traces
