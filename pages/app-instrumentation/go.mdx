# Go App Instrumentation

Follow the steps below to instrument your Go service. When completed, your service will appear in the Cardinal Service Catalog, and Chip will begin monitoring it.

### Local Testing

1. Get a Cardinal API key:

Sign in to your [Cardinal account,](http://app.cardinalhq.io) and get an API key from the Organization Settings > API Keys section.

2. TBD

3. Export the following environment variables:

```sh copy
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="your-service-name"
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="deployment.environment.name=local" # local/dev/staging/prod
export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER="otlp"
export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER="otlp"
export OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER="otlp"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://otelhttp.intake.us-east-2.aws.cardinalhq.io"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="x-cardinalhq-api-key=<your-api-key>" # Set your API key
```

4. Run your application:

```sh copy
go run <your-app.go>
```

5. Validate that Cardinal is receiving data:

Exercise the service by calling some API endpoints, or causing some logs or metrics to be emitted. Wait for a few minutes, then visit the Service Catalog in the [Cardinal UI](http://app.cardinalhq.io) to check that your service appears in the list.

### Docker

Set the environment variables outlined above in your Docker container runtime configuration.

- Update `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` to set the `deployment.environment.name` value to your environment.
- If you run an OpenTelemetry Collector, set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to your Collector's OTLP Receiver endpoint, and follow the steps in the [OTLP Export to Cardinal](/otel-collectors/export-to-cardinal) section to forward data to Cardinal.

### Kubernetes

Set the environment variables outlined above in your `Deployment` or `StatefulSet` manifest.

- Update `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` to set the `deployment.environment.name` value to your environment.
- If you run an OpenTelemetry Collector, set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to your Collector's OTLP Receiver endpoint, and follow the steps in the [OTLP Export to Cardinal](/otel-collectors/export-to-cardinal) section to forward data to Cardinal.

### Additional Integrations

#### Slog Logger

To use the standard library `slog` logger with Cardinal, you can use the `slog-multi` package.
This will allow you to log both to standard error (the console) and to Cardinal.

To set up the SDK, we will also be using our `oteltools` package to configure OpenTelemetry.

```go
include(
    "context"
    "log/slog"
    "os"
    "os/signal"
  	"syscall"

    slogmulti "github.com/samber/slog-multi"
	"github.com/cardinalhq/oteltools/pkg/telemetry"
    "go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/bridges/otelslog"

...

func main() {
    // Handle ^C and kubernetes termination gracefully.
    ctx, stop := signal.NotifyContext(context.Background(), os.Interrupt, syscall.SIGTERM)
    defer stop()

    // Check to see if the environment variable is set, and only enable it
    // when it is set.
    enableOtel := os.Getenv("OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT") != ""

    if enableOtel {
        slog.Info("OpenTelemetry exporting enabled")
		otelShutdown, err := telemetry.SetupOTelSDK(ctx)
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
        defer func() {
            err = errors.Join(err, otelShutdown(context.Background()))
        }()
    }

    slog.SetDefault(slog.New(slogmulti.Fanout(
        slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stdout, nil),
        otelslog.NewHandler(os.Getenv("OTEL_SERVICE_NAME")),
    )))

    // Your application logic here
}
```

#### Zap Logger
