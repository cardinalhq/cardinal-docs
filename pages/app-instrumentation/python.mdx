# Python App Instrumentation

Follow the steps below to auto-instrument your Python service. When completed, your service will appear in the Cardinal Service Catalog, and Chip will begin monitoring it.

### Local Testing

1. Get a Cardinal API key:

Sign in to your [Cardinal account,](http://app.cardinalhq.io) and get an API key from the Organization Settings > API Keys section.

2. Install the OpenTelemetry dependencies:

```sh copy
pip install opentelemetry-distro
pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
```

3. Enable auto-instrumentation:

```sh copy
opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install
```

3. Export the following environment variables:

```sh copy
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="your-service-name" # Set your service name
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="deployment.environment.name=local" # local/dev/staging/prod
export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER="otlp"
export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER="otlp"
export OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER="otlp"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://otelhttp.intake.us-east-2.aws.cardinalhq.io"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="x-cardinalhq-api-key=<your-api-key>" # Set your API key
```

4. Run your application:

```sh copy
opentelemetry-instrument python <your-app.py>
```

5. Validate that Cardinal is receiving data:

Exercise the service by calling some API endpoints, or causing some logs or metrics to be emitted. Wait for a few minutes, then visit the Service Catalog in the [Cardinal UI](http://app.cardinalhq.io) to check that your service appears in the list.

### Docker

Set the environment variables outlined above in your Docker container runtime configuration. 

- Update `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` to set the `deployment.environment.name` value to your environment.
- If you run an OpenTelemetry Collector, set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to your Collector's OTLP Receiver endpoint, and follow the steps in the [OTLP Export to Cardinal](/otel-collectors/export-to-cardinal) section to forward data to Cardinal.

### Kubernetes

Set the environment variables outlined above in your `Deployment` or `StatefulSet` manifest. 

- Update `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` to set the `deployment.environment.name` value to your environment.
- If you run an OpenTelemetry Collector, set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to your Collector's OTLP Receiver endpoint, and follow the steps in the [OTLP Export to Cardinal](/otel-collectors/export-to-cardinal) section to forward data to Cardinal.
