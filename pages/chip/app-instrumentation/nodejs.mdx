# Node.js App Instrumentation

Follow the steps below to auto-instrument your Node.js service. When completed, your service will appear in the Cardinal Service Catalog, and Chip will begin monitoring it.

### Local Testing

1. Get a Cardinal API key:

Sign in to your [Cardinal account,](http://app.cardinalhq.io) and get an API key from the Organization Settings > API Keys section.

2. Install the OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation dependencies:

```sh copy
npm install --save @opentelemetry/api
npm install --save @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node
```

3. Enable log forwarding:

See the [Pino Logger](#pino-logger) section below.

4. Export the following environment variables:

```sh copy
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="your-service-name" # Set your service name
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="deployment.environment.name=local" # local/dev/staging/prod
export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER="otlp"
export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER="otlp"
export OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER="otlp"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://otelhttp.intake.us-east-2.aws.cardinalhq.io"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="x-cardinalhq-api-key=<your-api-key>" # Set your API key
export NODE_OPTIONS="--require @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node/register"
```

5. Run your application:

```sh copy
npm run start # Or your application's start script
```

6. Validate that Cardinal is receiving data:

Exercise the service by calling some API endpoints, or causing some logs or metrics to be emitted. Wait for a few minutes, then visit the Service Catalog in the [Cardinal UI](http://app.cardinalhq.io) to check that your service appears in the list.

### Docker

Set the environment variables outlined above in your Docker container runtime configuration. 

- Update `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` to set the `deployment.environment.name` value to your environment.
- If you run an OpenTelemetry Collector, set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to your Collector's OTLP Receiver endpoint, and follow the steps in the [OTLP Export to Cardinal](/otel-collectors/export-to-cardinal) section to forward data to Cardinal.

### Kubernetes

Set the environment variables outlined above in your `Deployment` or `StatefulSet` manifest. 

- Update `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` to set the `deployment.environment.name` value to your environment.
- If you run an OpenTelemetry Collector, set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to your Collector's OTLP Receiver endpoint, and follow the steps in the [OTLP Export to Cardinal](/otel-collectors/export-to-cardinal) section to forward data to Cardinal.

### Additional Integrations

#### Pino Logger

Configure [Pino](https://getpino.io/) to forward logs to Cardinal.

1. Install the `pino-opentelemetry-transport` package:

```sh copy
npm install --save pino-opentelemetry-transport
```

2. Configure Pino to use the `pino-opentelemetry-transport` when you initialize the logger:

```js copy  
const logger = pino({
  transport: {
    targets: [
      {
        target: "pino/file",
        options: { destination: 1 }, // continues to write to stdout
      },
      {
        target: "pino-opentelemetry-transport",
        options: {},
      },
    ],
  },
});
```
