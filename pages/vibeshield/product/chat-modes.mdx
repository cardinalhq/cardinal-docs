# Agent Chat

Cardinal supports two chat modes: **Build Mode** (single-agent chat) for creating and configuring agents, and **Chat Mode** (multi-agent) for read-only, cross-agent conversations and workflows.

## At a Glance

- **Build Mode**: build agents, create assets, and tune capabilities.
- **Chat Mode**: read-only view across multiple agents.

## Build Mode (Single Chat)

**Best for:** building and refining a specific agent.

- Create agent-specific queries, workflows, and scripts.
- Add agent capabilities to improve reliability and optimize behavior.
- Work directly within the context of a single agent.

## Chat Mode (Multi-Agent)

**Best for:** communicating with multiple agents within a thread.

- Read-only access to multiple agents in one conversation.
- Great for getting questions answered and cross-domain visibility.
- Asset creation is disabled in this mode.

## Choosing the Right Mode

- Use **Build Mode** when you need to build or modify agent assets.
- Use **Chat Mode** when you want a read-only view across agents.
