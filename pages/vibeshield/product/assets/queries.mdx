# Queries

![Queries](/Queries.gif)

Queries are created as you build an agent. They become a reusable library the agent can search—matching new questions to similar past queries to answer faster and more consistently.

Ask **What are the top 5 GCP cost contributors?** and the agent will look up similar saved billing queries from your past work, reuse the closest match (or adapt it), run it against your connected billing data, and return a ranked breakdown with totals and percentages.

## Query Workflow

- **Auto-Generated** - Queries are automatically generated when you build your agent, capturing the information sources and logic needed
- **Iterate & Test** - Refine queries by editing and executing them or through chat, ensuring they return the right data
- **Publish to Organization** - Once the query looks good, publish it to make it available to the entire organization for use in reports, dashboards, and other agents
