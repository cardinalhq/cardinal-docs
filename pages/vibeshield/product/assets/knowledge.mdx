# Knowledge

![Knowledge](/Knowledgebase.png)

Knowledge is where you store trusted context at the org, datasource, or agent level so agents can use it to answer questions accurately and consistently.

## Key Benefits

- Provide agents with org-specific information and context
- Improve accuracy of agent responses with domain knowledge
- Enable agents to provide more personalized and contextual answers

## Knowledge Scope

You can add knowledge at different levels to match your needs:

- **Global Knowledge** - Organization-wide knowledge accessible to all agents across your instance
- **Connector-Specific Knowledge** - Knowledge tied to specific connectors, providing contextual information about particular datasources that agents can reference
- **Agent-Specific Knowledge** - Knowledge tailored to individual agents, allowing you to customize what information each agent has access to based on its role and responsibilities
