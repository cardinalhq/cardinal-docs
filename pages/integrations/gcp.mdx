# Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Send metrics and/or logs for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services to Cardinal.

Overall Steps:

1. (Logs) Set up a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic and subscription.
2. (Logs) Create a Google Cloud Log Router sink to route logs to the Pub/Sub topic.
3. (Logs / Metrics) Set up an OpenTelemetry Collector to pull logs from the Pub/Sub topic and send them to Cardinal.

## Set up Google Cloud Logs

The [Google Cloud Log Routing](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2#creating_sink) document
describes these steps in more detail.

_(If you are only interested in sending metrics, skip to the [next section.](#using-a-new-opentelemetry-collector))_

### Create a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic

1. Go to your [Topic List](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topic/list) in the Google Cloud Console and click the **Create Topic** button.
2. Give it a meaningful name, such as `cardinal-logs`, and click **Create**.

### Create a Google Cloud Pub/Sub subscription

In most cases a default subscription is automatically created when you create the topic.
If this did not happen, you will need to manually create it.

1. Go to your [Subscription List](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/subscription/list) in the Google Cloud Console and click the **Create Subscription** button.
2. Give it a meaningful name, such as `cardinal-logs-sub`.
3. Set the **Topic** to the topic you created in the previous step.
4. Set the **Delivery type** to **Pull**.
5. The remaining options can be left as default.

### Route logs to the Pub/Sub topic

1. Go to your [Log Router](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/router) in the Google Cloud Console.
1. Click the **Create Sink** button.
1. Give it a meaningful name, such as `cardinal-logs-sink`.
1. Click **Next**.
1. Set the **Sink Service** to **Cloud Pub/Sub Topic**.
1. Set the **Sink Destination** to the topic you created in the previous step.
1. Click **Next**.
1. In the **Choose logs to include in sink** step, you can either select specific logs or leave it as default to include all logs. For more information on this, refer to the [Logging Query Language](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/logging-query-language) documentation.
1. Click the **Create Sink** button to create the sink.

## Using a new OpenTelemetry Collector

These steps will guide you through setting up a minimal OpenTelemetry Collector on a Google Compute Engine (GCE) VM instance to collect metrics and logs for various Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services.

_(If you already have an existing OpenTelemetry Collector, skip to the [next section.](#using-an-existing-opentelemetry-collector))_

### Build and publish a Collector Docker image

1. Create the following Collector configuration file in a new directory:

```sh copy
touch config.yaml
```

```yaml copy
receivers:
  googlecloudpubsub: # For logs
    project: "${GCP_PROJECT_ID}"
    subscription: "${GCP_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME}"
    encoding: cloud_logging
  googlecloudmonitoring: # For metrics
    collection_interval: 1m
    project_id: "${GCP_PROJECT_ID}"
    metrics_list:
      # This is an example of how to collect all Google Cloud Run metrics.
      # You can find the full list of metrics in the Google Cloud Platform 
      # documentation â€“ https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp
      - metric_descriptor_filter: 'metric.type = starts_with("run.googleapis.com")'
processors:
  resource/env:
    attributes:
      - key: deployment.environment.name
        value: "${DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT}"
        action: upsert
      - key: service.name
        action: insert
        from_attribute: "gcp.service_name"
      - key: service.name
        action: insert
        from_attribute: "service_name"
exporters:
  otlphttp/cardinal:
    endpoint: "${CARDINALHQ_OTLP_ENDPOINT}"
    headers:
      x-cardinalhq-api-key: "${CARDINALHQ_API_KEY}"
service:
  pipelines:
    logs: # For logs
      receivers: [googlecloudpubsub]
      processors: [resource/env]
      exporters: [otlphttp/cardinal]
    metrics: # For metrics
      receivers: [googlecloudmonitoring]
      processors: [resource/env]
      exporters: [otlphttp/cardinal]
```

The environment variables will be set at runtime in a later step.

(Refer to the [googlecloudpubsub](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/googlecloudpubsubreceiver) and [googlecloudmonitoring](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/googlecloudmonitoringreceiver) receiver READMEs for more configuration options.)

2. Create a Dockerfile in the same directory:

```sh copy
touch Dockerfile
```

```dockerfile copy
FROM otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest

COPY config.yaml /etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml
```

3. Build and publish the Docker image to Google Artifact Registry:

(Replace `LOCATION`, `PROJECT_ID`, and `REPOSITORY` with your own values.)

```sh copy
export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64

docker build -t ${LOCATION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/${REPOSITORY}/otel-collector-gcp:latest .
docker push ${LOCATION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/${REPOSITORY}/otel-collector-gcp:latest
```

### Deploy the Collector to a GCE VM instance

1. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the [VM Instances page](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances).
2. Click the **Create Instance** button.
3. On the **Machine configuration** step, give the instance a name, and select the `e2-medium` machine type.
4. On the **OS and storage** step, click the **Deploy Container** button.

Set the **Container image** to the image you built in the previous step, and add the following environment variables to the instance:

- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: The ID of the GCP project to collect metrics from (e.g. `sandbox-124512`)
- `GCP_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME`: The name of the Google Cloud Pub/Sub subscription to collect logs from (e.g. `projects/your-project-id/subscriptions/your-subscription-name`)
- `DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT`: A name for the deployment environment (e.g. `dev` or `prod`)
- `CARDINALHQ_OTLP_ENDPOINT`: `https://otelhttp.intake.us-east-2.aws.cardinalhq.io`
- `CARDINALHQ_API_KEY`: Your Cardinal API key

![Container configuration](/gce_collector_container_config.png)

5. On the **Security** step, under the **Identity and API access > Access scopes** section, select **Set access for each API** and set the following:

- **Stackdriver Monitoring API:** `Full` (for metrics)
- **Cloud Pub/Sub:** `Read Only` (for logs)

![Security configuration](/gce_collector_security_config.png)

6. Click the **Create** button to deploy the instance.

7. Once the instance is up and running, SSH into it, and run the following command to verify that the Collector is running and collecting metrics and logs by tailing its logs:

```sh copy
docker ps # Get the Container ID of the Collector
docker logs -f <CONTAINER_ID> # View the logs of the Collector
```

## Using an existing OpenTelemetry Collector

1. Update your existing OpenTelemetry Collector configuration to include the yaml provided above.
2. Set the environment variables as shown above.
3. Restart the Collector to apply the changes.
4. Verify that the Collector is running and collecting metrics and logs by tailing its logs.
