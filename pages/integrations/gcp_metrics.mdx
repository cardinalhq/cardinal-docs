# Google Cloud Metrics

Send metrics for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services to Cardinal. 

### Using a new OpenTelemetry Collector

These steps will guide you through setting up a minimal OpenTelemetry Collector on a Google Compute Engine (GCE) VM instance to collect metrics for various Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services.

(If you already have an existing OpenTelemetry Collector, skip to the [next section.](#using-an-existing-opentelemetry-collector))

#### Build and publish a Collector Docker image

1. Create the following Collector configuration file in a new directory:

```sh copy
touch config.yaml
```

```yaml copy
receivers:
  googlecloudmonitoring:
    collection_interval: 1m
    project_id: "${GCP_PROJECT_ID}"
    metrics_list:
      # This is an example of how to collect all Google Cloud Run metrics.
      # You can find the full list of metrics in the Google Cloud Platform 
      # documentation – https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp
      - metric_descriptor_filter: 'metric.type = starts_with("run.googleapis.com")'
processors:
  resource/env:
    attributes:
      - key: deployment.environment.name
        value: "${DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT}"
        action: upsert
exporters:
  otlphttp/cardinal:
    endpoint: "${CARDINALHQ_OTLP_ENDPOINT}"
    headers:
      x-cardinalhq-api-key: "${CARDINALHQ_API_KEY}"
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [googlecloudmonitoring]
      processors: [resource/env]
      exporters: [otlphttp/cardinal]
```

(Refer to the [googlecloudmonitoringreceiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/googlecloudmonitoringreceiver) README for more configuration options.)

2. Create a Dockerfile in the same directory:

```sh copy
touch Dockerfile
```

```dockerfile copy
FROM otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest

COPY config.yaml /etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml
```

3. Build and publish the Docker image to Google Artifact Registry:

(Replace `LOCATION`, `PROJECT_ID`, and `REPOSITORY` with your own values.)

```sh copy
export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64

docker build -t ${LOCATION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/${REPOSITORY}/otel-collector-googlecloudmonitoring:latest .
docker push ${LOCATION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/${REPOSITORY}/otel-collector-googlecloudmonitoring:latest
```

#### Deploy the Collector to a GCE VM instance

1. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the [VM Instances page](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances).
2. Click the **Create Instance** button.
3. On the **Machine configuration** step, give the instance a name, and select the `e2-medium` machine type.
4. On the **OS and storage** step, click the **Deploy Container** button.

Set the **Container image** to the image you built in the previous step, and add the following environment variables to the instance:

- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: The ID of the GCP project to collect metrics from (e.g. `sandbox-124512`).
- `DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT`: A name for the deployment environment (e.g. `dev` or `prod`).
- `CARDINALHQ_OTLP_ENDPOINT`: `https://otelhttp.intake.us-east-2.aws.cardinalhq.io`
- `CARDINALHQ_API_KEY`: Your Cardinal API key.

5. On the **Security** step, under the **Identity and API access > Access scopes** section, select **Set access for each API** and set the **Stackdriver Monitoring API** option to `Full`.

6. Click the **Create** button to deploy the instance.

7. Once the instance is up and running, SSH into it, and run the following command to verify that the Collector is running and collecting metrics by tailing its logs:

```sh copy
docker ps # Get the Container ID of the Collector
docker logs -f <CONTAINER_ID> # View the logs of the Collector
```

### Using an existing OpenTelemetry Collector

Update your existing OpenTelemetry Collector configuration to include the following:

```yaml copy
receivers:
  googlecloudmonitoring:
    collection_interval: 1m
    project_id: "${GCP_PROJECT_ID}"
    metrics_list:
      # This is an example of how to collect all Google Cloud Run metrics.
      # You can find the full list of metrics in the Google Cloud Platform 
      # documentation – https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp
      - metric_descriptor_filter: 'metric.type = starts_with("run.googleapis.com")'
processors:
  resource/env:
    attributes:
      - key: deployment.environment.name
        value: "${DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT}"
        action: upsert
exporters:
  otlphttp/cardinal:
    endpoint: "${CARDINALHQ_OTLP_ENDPOINT}"
    headers:
      x-cardinalhq-api-key: "${CARDINALHQ_API_KEY}"
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [googlecloudmonitoring]
      processors: [resource/env]
      exporters: [otlphttp/cardinal]
```

(Refer to the [googlecloudmonitoringreceiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/googlecloudmonitoringreceiver) README for more configuration options.)

Set the following environment variables for your Collector:

- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: The ID of the GCP project to collect metrics from (e.g. `sandbox-124512`).
- `DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT`: A name for the deployment environment (e.g. `dev` or `prod`).
- `CARDINALHQ_OTLP_ENDPOINT`: `https://otelhttp.intake.us-east-2.aws.cardinalhq.io`
- `CARDINALHQ_API_KEY`: Your Cardinal API key.

Restart the Collector to apply the changes.

Verify that the Collector is running and collecting metrics by tailing its logs.
