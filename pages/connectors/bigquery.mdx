# BigQuery

Connect Cardinal Agent Builder to Google BigQuery data warehouse.

## Overview

BigQuery is Google Cloud's fully managed, serverless data warehouse. With the BigQuery connector, your AI agents can:

- **Query data** using standard SQL
- **Discover schemas** and table structures automatically
- **Analyze large datasets** with semantic search across tables
- **Monitor query metrics** including bytes processed and execution time
- **Analyze GCP costs** by project, service, and SKU
- **Detect resource underutilization** across Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, GKE, and other services
- **Generate optimization recommendations** for rightsizing and cost savings
- **Identify expensive BigQuery queries** and explain cost drivers

## Connection Details

| Field              | Description                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Project**        | Browse and select a Google Cloud project from the grid |
| **Authentication** | Google OAuth 2.0                                       |
| **Datasets**       | Browse and select specific datasets (optional)         |
| **Tables**         | Browse and select specific tables (optional)           |

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud project with BigQuery enabled
- A Google account with access to your BigQuery project
- At least one BigQuery dataset with tables

## Setup Wizard

### Step 1: Authenticate with Google

1. In Cardinal Agent Builder, go to **Connectors** and click **Browse Connectors**
2. Select **BigQuery**
3. Click **Authenticate with Google**
4. You'll be redirected to Google's OAuth consent screen
5. Grant Cardinal Agent Builder access to your BigQuery data
6. Return to Cardinal Agent Builder — authentication is complete

### Step 2: Select Your Project

1. Browse the list of available Google Cloud projects
   - Search for a specific project using the search box, or scroll through the grid
   - Click on the project card containing your BigQuery datasets
   - You can only select one project per datasource connection

### Step 3: Select Datasets and Tables

1. **Select datasets** from the available datasets in your project

   - Browse the grid of available datasets in your selected project
   - Click on the dataset cards to select one or more datasets
   - If you skip this step, all datasets in the project are accessible

2. **Select tables** to restrict access to specific tables (optional)
   - Browse and click on specific table cards to select which tables the agent can query
   - If you skip this step, all tables in the selected datasets are accessible
   - Useful for security: limit agents to specific tables only

### Step 4: Save Configuration

1. Review your selected project, datasets, and tables
2. Click **Save**
3. Cardinal Agent Builder will verify connectivity and discover the schema for your selected datasets and tables

Your AI agent can now query BigQuery and answer questions about your data.
