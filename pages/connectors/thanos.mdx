# Thanos

Connect Cardinal Agent Builder to Thanos for querying and analyzing long-term metrics storage.

## Overview

Thanos is an open-source project that extends Prometheus with long-term storage capabilities and global query views. With the Thanos connector, your AI agents can:

- **Query metrics** across multiple Prometheus instances
- **Access long-term metric storage** and historical data
- **Analyze time-series data** with high availability
- **Track metric trends** over extended periods
- **Identify patterns** in long-term metric data

## Connection Details

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Display Name** | Custom name for this Thanos connection |
| **Thanos Query URL** | Base URL of your Thanos Query server |

## Prerequisites

- Thanos Query server deployed and running
- Base URL for your Thanos Query server (e.g., `http://localhost:9090`)
- Network access to the Thanos Query server
- Metrics data available in Thanos storage

## Setup Wizard

### Step 1: Connection Configuration
