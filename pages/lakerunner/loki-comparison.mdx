## Lakerunner vs. Loki: TCO Comparison

### Storage Costs

| Dimension | Loki | Cardinal Lakerunner |
| - | - | - |
| Primary storage | High cost SSD for speed | Low-cost Object storage (S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc) |
| Storage format | Proprietary | Open: Apache Parquet |
| Compression efficiency | Moderate | Very high |
| Retention cost | High beyond short windows | Low and linear, even at years of retention |

**Key insight:** Loki's storage model is optimized for recent access, not
long-term value. Storing months or years of logs for analysis quickly becomes
expensive.

Cardinal Lakerunner stores data in analytics-optimized formats, allowing
multi-year retention at a fraction of the cost—often orders of magnitude
cheaper than traditional log systems.

### Indexing Costs

Loki relies heavily on label indexes:

* High-cardinality labels increase memory, CPU, and operational cost
* Teams are often forced to limit labels, which limits insight
* Accidents where high-cardinality labels are added can quickly increase cost

Cardinal Lakerunner takes a different approach:

* Cardinal Lakerunner loves cardinality
* Minimal ingest-time indexing
* Only a lightweight overview index is maintained outside of object storage
* Full detail lives in S3-compatible storage and is accessed only when needed

**Result:** Cardinal Lakerunner dramatically reduces the amount of expensive
non-S3 infrastructure while still enabling rich, flexible queries later.

### Compute Costs

| Aspect | Loki | Cardinal Lakerunner |
| - | - | - |
| Compute Model | Reserved or On-Demand | Spot or Preemptable |
| Storage Model | SSD recommended for query speed | Object Storage with minimal SQL index |
| Query execution | Always online | On-demand |
| Idle cost | High | Automatic on-demand scaling |
| Heavy queries | Query and ingestion scale together | Isolated workloads for fine-grained scaling |

With Loki, every query competes with ingestion and indexing. As usage grows
across teams, this leads to over-provisioning, query throttling, and rising
infrastructure spend.

Cardinal Lakerunner decouples ingestion from analysis: data is processed once,
queries spin up compute only when needed, and the system does not need to be
sized for peak analytical demand 24/7.

### Operational Overhead

#### Loki

* Careful label hygiene required
* Scaling challenges with high cardinality
* Continuous tuning as usage grows
* Debugging the debugger becomes a cost center

#### Cardinal Lakerunner

* Ingest once, analyze many times
* Fewer hot paths
* Cloud-native with cost-effective deployment models
* Object storage handles durability and scale
* Predictable cost model based on signal volume

## Teams May Start with Loki

Teams often begin with Loki when:

* You only need short-term debugging
* Retention is measured in days or weeks
* Logs are viewed primarily by engineers
* Cost growth is not a major concern (yet)

---

## Cardinal Lakerunner Wins on TCO

Cardinal Lakerunner delivers lower total cost when:

* Logs are used beyond incident response
* You want observability to inform business and operational decisions
* Retention matters (months or years)
* You want predictable, declining cost per GB over time
* You want more than just logs
