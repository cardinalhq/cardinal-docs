[Lakerunner](https://github.com/cardinalhq/lakerunner) transforms an S3-compatible bucket into a **production-grade Observability stack** in minutes.

## What is Lakerunner?

Lakerunner is an open-source observability data lake that stores logs, metrics, and traces in cloud object storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob). It provides:

- **Cost-effective storage** - Store petabytes of observability data at object storage prices
- **Fast queries** - Columnar format with intelligent indexing for sub-second queries
- **Native Grafana integration** - Query your data lake directly from Grafana
- **Kubernetes-native** - Deploy with Helm, scale with KEDA

## Deployment Options

Lakerunner supports three deployment modes:

| Mode | Use Case | Infrastructure |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Kind / Local** | Development and testing | Local Kubernetes (Kind/Minikube) |
| **Kubernetes POC** | Proof of concept with real cloud resources | Any Kubernetes cluster |
| **Production** | Full HA deployment | Production Kubernetes with autoscaling |

## Getting Started

Ready to deploy? Head to the [Installation Guide](/lakerunner/install) to get started with our interactive setup wizard.

### Prerequisites

Before installing Lakerunner, ensure you have:

1. [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) - Kubernetes CLI
2. [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) 3.14+ - Package manager for Kubernetes
3. Kubernetes cluster 1.28+ (local or cloud)

For **POC and Production** deployments, you'll also need:
- S3-compatible object storage with notification capability (S3, GCS, or Azure Blob)
- PostgreSQL 16+ database
- Kafka cluster (minimum 2 brokers for production)
- [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) - Highly recommended for production autoscaling
