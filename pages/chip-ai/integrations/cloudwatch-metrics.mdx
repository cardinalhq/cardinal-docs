# Chip!

In modern engineering organizations, effective monitoring requires
minimizing alert noise and reducing setup complexity. Chip, developed
by former Netflix engineers, addresses these challenges by
automatically analyzing telemetry data—including custom metrics—to
surface critical issues without extensive configuration. Its built-in
support for OpenTelemetry allows quick integration into existing
systems, typically within 30 minutes. Chip helps engineering teams
maintain focus on core development tasks while ensuring reliable
system observability.

# AWS CloudWatch Metrics

AWS CloudWatch provides real-time monitoring of your AWS resources and
applications by collecting key metrics and logs. Integrating CloudWatch
metrics with Cardinal’s Chip via AWS Firehose is quick and
straightforward, taking just a few minutes to set up. Once
integrated, Chip analyzes your CloudWatch metrics alongside other
telemetry data, such as Kubernetes metrics and logs, delivering
comprehensive insights into your system’s performance without the
hassle of manually managing CloudWatch alerts and alarms.

## Prerequisites

- A Cardinal Gateway Collector installed in a Kubernetes cluster.
- AWS permissions to create a Data Firehose stream and a CloudWatch metric stream,
  s3 buckets, and the associated IAM roles and policies.
- Permission in the Kubernetes cluster to create an Ingress resource with TLS termination.

## Quick Start

### Configure Cardinal Gateway Collector

- Log into your account at [CardinalHQ](https://app.cardinalhq.io).
- Navigate to the **Pipelines** configuration tab.

- Select your Gateway collector from the dropdown.
- Click **Add a source** (bottom-left of the pipeline graph).

  />
- Choose **AWS Firehose Metrics**.
- Set a port between `1024` and `65535`. The acutal port here does not matter, and will be used
  by the ingress step to route traffic to the collector. The port should not already be used by
  another receiver on this collector.
- Choose `JSON` as the encoding.
- Create and securely store an **Access Key** for authentication. This access key is
  used to authenticate the AWS Firehose stream to the Cardinal Gateway collector.
  Its value should be a random string of at least 16 characters.

### Configure Kubernetes Ingress

- AWS Firehose requires a TLS-secured (`https://`) endpoint.
- Set up Kubernetes Ingress with a TLS certificate. Refer to your environment’s specific documentation to accomplish this step.

## Configure AWS Firehose

- Log into the AWS Console.
- Navigate to **Amazon Data Firehose**.
- Click **Create Firehose Stream**.
  - Source: Select **Direct PUT**.
  - Destination: Select **HTTP Endpoint**.

      src="/chip/integrations/cloudwatch-metrics/firehose-source.png"
      width={3136}
      height={498}
    />
  - Enter your TLS-secured collector endpoint (`https://...`).

      src="/chip/integrations/cloudwatch-metrics/firehose-destination.png"
      width={2180}
      height={496}
    />
  - Authentication: Select **Use access key** and input your earlier-created key.

      width={2134}
      height={520}
    />
  - Content Encoding: Select **GZIP**.

      width={1158}
      height={216}
    />
  - Optional: Add additional OpenTelemetry attributes via **Add parameter**.
  - Expand **Buffer hints**, and set "size" to "1" and "interval" to "60".

      src="/chip/integrations/cloudwatch-metrics/firehose-buffer-hints.png"
      width={2528}
      height={752}
    />
  - Choose S3 Bucket options:
    - Recommended: Select **Failed data only**.
    - Set retention policies and encryption as required for compliance.

        width={1528}
        height={962}
      />
- Click **Create firehose stream**.

## Configure AWS CloudWatch Stream

- In AWS Console, navigate to **CloudWatch → Metrics → Streams**.
- Click **Create metric stream**.
  - Select **Custom setup with Firehose**.
    <Image
      src="/chip/integrations/cloudwatch-metrics/cloudwatch-destination.png"
      width={1720}
      height={830}
    />
  - Select your newly created Firehose from the dropdown.
  - Change output format to **JSON**.

      src="/chip/integrations/cloudwatch-metrics/cloudwatch-output-format.png"
      width={1636}
      height={560}
    />
  - Select desired metrics (all or specific services, e.g., RDS). This list can be changed later.

      src="/chip/integrations/cloudwatch-metrics/cloudwatch-metric-selection-all.png"
      width={1648}
      height={590}
    />
    <Image
      src="/chip/integrations/cloudwatch-metrics/cloudwatch-metric-selection-rds.png"
      width={1642}
      height={1138}
    />
  - Name your metric stream (optional).
- Click **Create metric stream**.

### Verify that metrics are flowing

- Navigate back to the Data Firehose service, and examine the metrics for the firehose you created.
- After some short time, you should see data coming in, and data being sent over HTTP.  There should be no errors logged.
  <Image
    src="/chip/integrations/cloudwatch-metrics/firehose-confirmation.png"
    width={2560}
    height={1632}
  />
- If you see errors, check
  - That the ingress into your collector is fully set up and functional
  - That the endpoint configured on the firehose is correct.
- If you see no data
  - Check that the CloudWatch metric stream is sending data to the Firehose.

## Relax

Chip is now actively monitoring your AWS CloudWatch metrics. You can relax as Chip proactively identifies anomalies and correlates metric data with your Kubernetes infrastructure.
