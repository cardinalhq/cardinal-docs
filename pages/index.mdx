# Quick Start

Ready to see how [Chip](https://cardinalhq.io) can get you from instrumentation to **incident-ready** in minutes? ðŸš€

Chip is **OpenTelemetry-native**, so whether you're new to OTel, or using it already, you'll be able to get onboarded in under 30 minutes.

### New to OpenTelemetry?

For the fastest onboarding experience, we recommend auto-instrumenting your applications using the open-source, vendor-neutral OpenTelemetry SDKs. This gives you baseline telemetry out-of-the-box, with zero (or minimal) code changes.

*(If you currently use vendor-specific SDKs or agents, like the Datadog Agent, DogStatsD, or dd-trace, you can still add the OpenTelemetry SDKs to try Chip without disrupting your existing vendor usage.)*

Select your language:

- [Node.js](/app-instrumentation/nodejs)
- [Python](/app-instrumentation/python)
- [Java](/app-instrumentation/java)
- [Go](/app-instrumentation/go)
- [React.js](/app-instrumentation/reactjs)


### Existing OpenTelemetry users

If your applications are already instrumented using OpenTelemetry SDKs, and you're running an OpenTelemetry Collector, getting onboarded to Chip is as simple as adding an OTLP Exporter to your Collector pipeline.

Select your preferred option:

[Add an OTLP Exporter to send data to Cardinal](/otel-collectors/export-to-cardinal) 
  - Recommended for fast onboarding, PoCs, or if your telemetry data volume is low
  - Sends raw telemetry data to Cardinal

OR

[Install the Cardinal OpenTelemetry Collector](/otel-collectors/cardinal-collector)
  - Recommended if your telemetry data volume is high
  - Runs downstream of your existing Collector, within your VPC/infrastructure
  - Sends < 0.01% of your data to Cardinal (only exemplars and aggregates, not raw data)
