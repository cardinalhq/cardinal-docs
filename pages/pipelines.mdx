# Collector Pipelines

A Collector Pipeline consists of one or more telemetry [Sources](./pipelines/sources) and [Destinations,](./pipelines/destinations) and [Rules](./pipelines/rules) that can be applied to enrich, transform, filter, and aggregate data.

Pipelines are fully managed through the [Cardinal UI,](https://app.cardinalhq.io) and Collectors continuously stay up to date with the latest Pipeline configurations.
